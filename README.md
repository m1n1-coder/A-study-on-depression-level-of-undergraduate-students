# A-study-on-depression-level-of-undergraduate-students
Through a google form, I have collected the responses from my fellow students. In each sample, various factors are responsible for the level of depression.
The Google form link is: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11R9K9yS4L9rgMgOksrXt805HcIknsJ1tFWxaHEZS-cg/edit

After gathering sufficient responses, different ML (Machine Learning) algorithms such as, Apriori, Decision Tree, K-means clustering, etc. were employed to analyze the factor and investigate the relation among the factors of happiness/depression.
